<h1>Hi ðŸ¤™, I'm Haris</h1>
<h3>A software engineer and a great guy</h3>

<div>
I like web and cloud-native technologies. While writing my thesis, internet of things and edge computing piqued my interest. It's now hard to keep myself from buying more pi boards and microcontrollers. Besides coding, I also spend lots of time outdoors - you can find me riding a bike or windsurfing, among others.
