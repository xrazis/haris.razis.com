    Title: Hey,
    Content: |
      I create bugs for a living, and this corner of the web is my digital garden ‚Äî a small collection of things I‚Äôve 
      learned and done over the years. Here, you‚Äôll find my projects, technical insights, and stories from my adventures.
      
      After trying all sorts of hobbies, I've concluded that riding bikes and motorcycles is my thing. I've gotten 
      especially good at breaking bones, a true talent, one might say. For tales of cracked crankcases and lost 
      paperwork in distant lands, click the yellow highlighted dates and tags.
      
      My default handle is **xrazis**.
