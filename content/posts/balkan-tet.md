# Introduction

The [Trans Euro Trail](https://transeurotrail.org/) (abbreviated TET) is a scenic GPX route that spans the whole
European continent. At the time of writing its length is somewhere around 100.000 kilometers, and it is constantly
growing. Each country has its respective linesmen that curates the GPX, but the community behind is much bigger than a
single person!

I have known Christos for the better part of my adult life. We met at a bicycle group ride I participated with my other
dearest friend, Apostolos. We all hit it along from the beginning, so we started riding, camping, touring, and racing
bikes together. After the frenzy of the road bicycle thing steamed off for me and Christos, we both turned to
motorbikes, since carrying a bicycle with us was no more a worry.

My first big bike was (and still is) a KTM LC4 640 Enduro. Christos purchased a Suzuki V-STROM 650. We rode a few times
together but due to COVID and us living in different areas for a while it was mostly short road rides. I already
travelled a lot off-road by that point and was constantly telling my friends how awesome it is to ride on hard
and difficult roads through the mountains where you get to injure yourself in the process.

I think the point where it clicked for him was the first off-road ride we did together, 2 or 3 years ago.

Having done my self a big part of the Greek TET, it was a no-brainer when Christos told me we should go on a big trip to
the Balkans. Up to that point we both had mid-sized adventure bikes, enough experience to tackle hard roads on them, and
not enough experience to travel long distance on motorcycles.

# Albania

We left noon of the first day of June and decided to ride the national road to the border crossing of Konispol. This way
we could stay at Sarand√´ for the night and start the TET fresh the next day. The first part from Sarand√´ to K√´lcyr√´ was
nothing new for us, the scenery was (obviously) very similar to Greece and the off-road was mostly rocky.

After food, we continued riding with the purpose of finding a nice camping spot where we could spend the night. And
Christos did. He managed to hit a rock with such force and at such a bad angle that a retaining screw holding the
bash plate bent the frame and pierced through the oil pan.

Guess what was the one thing we bought but forgot to pack? Yes, metal glue. After a day's back and forth to the closest
village, that was about 30kms from where we camped the night, we managed to find some cold steel and car oil to fix the
Tenere.

We decided to go to Elbassan for the night, which was a 4-hour drive from where we were. After a quick coffee stop at
Berat, we arrived at Elbassan and toured their beautiful old city. The fourth day we had planned to do 250km and spend
the night somewhere close the border, so we could enter Montenegro the next morning. So we thought.

align=center link="/blog/balkan-tet/IMG_2945.jpg" target="_blank" >}}

The road up to the mine was not really bad, but we were tired and hungry. We still had 60kms in the Lura mountain and
then an easy gravel road towards Shkod√´r. I can say with certainty, these were some of the most difficult kilometers
I've had on two wheels. We needed nearly 3 hours to cross the rest of the Lura mountain, as it was extremely rocky, and
we struggled with the heavy bikes. They warned us that we would end up passing the point of no return and the road ahead
would be gruelling, and boy did we not listen.

After a good nights sleep and some excellent food at Fush√´-Lur√´ we were off for Montenegro. We planned an easy day and
a stay at Podgorica, so we could have some much-needed rest.

At Podgorica, we decided that camping and travelling at such a fast pace was not manageable. We didn't want to waste
time getting food supplies and cooking, setting and gathering the gear, and doing all the things camp related. Don't get
me wrong, we both enjoy camping, it just did not make sense as rooms were cheap and the food even cheaper. We left our
camping gear at the rooms we were staying, and we would pick it up on the
return. [Lightweight baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRcR-_nF84o)!

I had a little mishap at the plateau displayed above where I managed to throw the 790 into a mud pit, and we spend the
next 45 minutes trying to pull it out. Including that, it made the perfect day on a bike. We slept near the border and
the morning after we crossed to Bosnia.

The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina ended in 1995 leaving over 100.000 dead, millions displaced, and thousands of mines
still active. There were multiple occasions were we passed by group graves with 300 or 400 names written on the
tombstone or plains that were completely altered by bombing.

At Bosnia, we spent our first night at Mostar. A beautiful city - although a bit touristic - that has a Unesco heritage
site, the old bridge of Stari Most. The bridge was completely destroyed in 1993, but was reconstructed from the very
same materials, retrieved from the river bellow!

Our second night at Bosnia was near the border to Croatia, at Glamoƒç. Nothing special, just a nights sleep and off to
Croatia. At Knin we decided to have a rest day and do some sightseeing.
