# Introduction

The [Trans Euro Trail](https://transeurotrail.org/) (TET) is a scenic GPX route that spans the
entire European continent. As of now, its length is approximately 100,000 kilometers and continues to grow. Each country
has its own linesman to curate the GPX, but the community behind it is much larger than just one person!

I have known Christos for the better part of my adult life. We met at a bicycle group ride I participated with my other
dearest friend, Apostolos. We hit it off from the start, which led us to riding, camping, touring, and racing bikes
together. As the excitement of road biking waned for Christos and me, we transitioned to motorbikes, freeing us from the
hassle of transporting bicycles.

My first big bike was (and still is) a KTM LC4 640 Enduro. Christos purchased a Suzuki V-STROM 650. We rode a few times
together but due to COVID and us living in different areas for a while it was mostly short road rides. By that point, I
had already traveled extensively off-road and often shared with my friends how exhilarating it is to navigate
challenging mountain roads, despite the occasional risk of injury.

I believe the moment it clicked for Christos was during our first off-road ride together 2 or 3 years ago.

Having done my self a big part of the Greek TET, it was a no-brainer when Christos told me we should go on a big trip to
the Balkans. Up to that point we both had mid-sized adventure bikes, enough experience to tackle hard roads on them, and
not enough experience to travel long distance on motorcycles.

# The story

We left noon of the first day of June and decided to ride the national road to the border crossing of Konispol. This
allowed us to stay in Sarand√´ for the night and start the TET fresh the next day. The initial section from Sarand√´ to
K√´lcyr√´ was familiar terrain for us; the scenery closely resembled Greece, and the off-road was predominantly rocky.

After lunch, we continued riding with the goal of finding a suitable camping spot for the night. Unfortunately, Christos
had a mishap. He struck a rock with such force and at such a bad angle that a retaining screw holding the bash plate
bent the frame and pierced through the oil pan.

{{< figure src="/blog/balkan-tet/IMG_2860.jpg" attr="The still pink 10-50 oil at the Albanian Countryside."

Of course, the one crucial item we bought but forgot to pack was metal glue. After a day of back-and-forth trips to the
nearest village, about 30 km from our campsite, we finally found some cold steel and car oil to repair the Tenere.

align=center link="/blog/balkan-tet/PXL_20240604_091839484.jpg" target="_blank" >}}

We decided to head to Elbassan for the night, a 4-hour drive from our location. After a brief coffee stop in Berat, we
arrived in Elbassan and explored its beautiful old city. The fourth day we had planned to do 250km and spend
the night somewhere close the border, so we could enter Montenegro the next morning. So we thought.

align=center link="/blog/balkan-tet/IMG_2945.jpg" target="_blank" >}}

The road up to the mine wasn't too bad, but we were tired and hungry. We still had 60 km through the Lura mountain and
then an easy gravel road towards Shkod√´r. Without a doubt, these were some of the most challenging kilometers I've ever
ridden on two wheels. We needed nearly 3 hours to cross the rest of the Lura mountain, as it was extremely rocky, and
we struggled with the heavy bikes. They warned us that we would end up passing the point of no return and the road ahead
would be gruelling, and boy did we not listen.

After a good nights sleep and some excellent food at Fush√´-Lur√´ we were off for Montenegro. We planned a relaxing day
with a stay in Podgorica to get some much-needed rest.

In Podgorica, we realized that camping while traveling at such a fast pace was impractical. We didn't want to waste
time on tasks like gathering food supplies, cooking, and setting up camp. Don't misunderstand, we both love camping.
However, it didn't seem practical since accommodations were inexpensive and food was even cheaper. We left our camping
gear in the rooms where we stayed and planned to retrieve it on our way
back. [Lightweight baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRcR-_nF84o)!

I had a little mishap at the plateau displayed above where I managed to throw the 790 into a mud pit, and we spend the
next 45 minutes trying to pull it out. Including that, it made the perfect day on a bike. We slept near the border and
the morning after we crossed to Bosnia.

The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina ended in 1995, leaving over 100,000 dead, millions displaced, and thousands of active
mines. There were multiple occasions were we passed by group graves with 300 or 400 names written on the
tombstone or plains that were completely altered by bombing.

In Bosnia, we spent our first night in Mostar, a beautiful city, albeit a bit touristic, home to the UNESCO World
Heritage site, the old bridge of Stari Most. The bridge was completely destroyed in 1993, but was reconstructed from the
very same materials, retrieved from the river bellow!

Our second night at Bosnia was near the border to Croatia, at Glamoƒç. Nothing special, just a nights sleep and off to
Croatia. At Knin we decided to have a rest day and do some sightseeing.
Their [fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knin_Fortress) is actually the most important stronghold of Croatia and
has had a turbulent history.

The next day, the dirt section of the TET was fairly easy, so since we were close
to [Plitvice Lakes](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gChHFsMRHR3aZT5i8), we decided to take a detour and visit the national park.

attr="The park is better visited late as there are close to no people."
align=center link="/blog/balkan-tet/IMG_3182.jpg" target="_blank" >}}

We found a stay near the lakes and the next day we were off to finish the Croatian TET. We woke up to rain but the
weather quickly got better.

The TET ends at the Slovenian boarder, near the town of Delnice. We chose to skip the final
section since it was paved, and instead headed to Zadar for our first overnight stay on the way back. We chose Zadar as
it seemed good-looking enough on the photos (as it actually was irl) and it was on our way as we wanted to visit Split
and Dubrovnik.

{{< figure src="/blog/balkan-tet/IMG_3202.jpg"

We spent an additional two nights in Montenegro because it was our favorite of them all. The first night was in Kotor,
and the second was back in Podgorica.

With an extra day left, we decided to stay in Ioannina and then take the Greek TET to Spercheiada through Agrafa.
Unfortunately, the Tenere had other plans and started leaking oil from the previously repaired spot. Luckily we found a
stronger metal glue at Ioannina, and repaired it without loosing any of the oil. Because we lost a couple of hours in
that process and had a lot of riding to get to Spercheiada we decided to skip that part and go straight to Athens.

# Wrap up

Being our first major off-road motorcycle journey, we learned a lot.

- Enduro clothing is the way to go for such trips. Although disadvantageous on a highway crash their off-road and high
  temperature comfort is unparalleled.
- Camping can be challenging for two people on motorcycles. An alternative approach we're interested in trying involves
  setting up a stationary camp and exploring the surroundings, rather than camping along the way when covering long
  distances.
- 30 liters are enough to carry your personal belongings and tools.
- A break of 1-2 days in the middle of the trip is necessary for rest.
- The rack-less panniers take some time to figure out, but once you do, you almost forget they're on the bike.
- What can go wrong, will go wrong.

Up next is Cappadocia with a pillion!
