# Introduction

We had been planning a trip to Cappadocia for months, Yiannoula and I started drafting a route from early 2024. When
Christos and I were doing part of the [Balkan TET](/posts/balkan-tet/), we would spend our evenings planning Cappadocia.
Funny to say the least. We didn't know where we would spend then night, but apparently, we were concerned about how many
luggage liters would be suitable for two up all the way to Cappadocia. Cilia would be Christos pillion—she needed
little to none persuasion to join us.

We would enter and leave Turkey from Çeşme. It made no sense to drive all the way to Alexandroupoli to cross the border
when we could just hop on the ferry and sleep the whole way there. Our plan was to go to Cappadocia through Isparta and
Konya, continue north to Ankara, drive by the Black Sea to İstanbul, and eventually make our way south by the Aegean,
where we would again board a boat at Çeşme.

# The story

### Athens → Chios → Çeşme

We boarded the ferry on Sunday night, and after a short delay off we were, officially the start of our journey! We
arrived at Chios after eight gruelling hours on the ship's deck, around six in the morning. The next ferry would leave
at eight, so we took a stroll down the marina while waiting.

{{< figure src="/blog/cappadocia/20241014_065111.webp" attr="As luck would have it, mishaps would start soon enough."

Before you board the ferry to Turkey, you have to go through Greek customs, bikes included, and when you arrive in
Turkey, you have to go through their customs as well. It was moments before the boarding when Christos remembered
that he forgot to issue a new green card for his bike.

> The 'green card' is a certificate of international insurance and is necessary when traveling to countries outside
> the European Economic Zone.

We decided to go forth with it and try to get through, which of course, did not work out. Apparently, the custom
authorities are pretty strict on things like that. Who would have guessed. After some back and forth with the Greek
authorities, they decided to let us through and let their Turkish counterparts deal with us. If we did not have the
right paperwork, we would be sent straight back to Chios with the next ferry. We rushed to the ship and hopped on at the
last possible moment.

Our plan was simple enough, we had about 45 minutes to contact the insurance company and get the green card issued.
Small problem, it was eight in the morning, on a Monday. After placing a few phone calls, we managed to get hold of
Christos agent, who unfortunately was sick and on a leave. Luckily, he was kind enough to call the right person at the
insurance company and get him to issue us a green card as fast as possible.

Should my technologically illiterate friend have had an online insurance, we could have done this ourselves and almost
instantly.

Once the green card was emailed to us, we went through the Turkish side of the customs. I was part of a random check,
where they even passed the bike through an X-ray scanner. Our first stop would be Pamukkale, about 350 kilometers away.

### Çeşme → Pamukkale

Pamukkale in Turkish means 'cotton castle'. The city is surrounded by cotton fields, and the hills surrounding Pamukkale
are white as snow from the sediment (travertine) that has been deposited over the years.

We found the entrance to the Unesco world heritage site to be ridiculously expensive, and in combination with the large
crowds on the hills, we decided to skip it. We would soon realize that all the popular attractions had high ticket
prices for the tourists, whereas natives would pay a tenth of the price.

On our way out from Pamukkale, we had a quick stop at Red Springs, where most of the locals would hang out.

That would wrap our short visit to Pamukkale; unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype.

### Pamukkale → Eğirdir

The day after we would drive to the Isparta region through a collection of salty lakes, with no particular destination
in mind.

The night caught us at Eğirdir, which is located alongside the homonymous lake, the second-biggest fresh water lake in
Turkey. We would have an awful stay at one of the few (last-minute) hotel options of the city.

{{< figure src="/blog/cappadocia/IMG_3839.webp"
attr="The busy street market alleys were completely empty at night."

Turkey has the highest per capita tea consumption in the world! With over 3kgs consumed annually per person, you will
find tea houses everywhere. They are mostly visited by men and called kiraathane.

{{< figure src="/blog/cappadocia/IMG_3845.webp"
attr="The owner of the tea house where he treated us like home."
align=center link="/blog/cappadocia/IMG_3845.webp" target="_blank" >}}

Despite both the
[Greek](https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/europe-and-central-asia/western-central-and-south-eastern-europe/greece/)
and the
[Turkish](https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/europe-and-central-asia/western-central-and-south-eastern-europe/turkiye/)
governments being lousy and having a
[long history of conflicts and bad diplomatic relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece%E2%80%93Turkey_relations)
, we people know better than that. Anywhere we went, we would be greeted with
excitement, and more often than not, we would be treated to chai (their local tea). A true testament to the kindness and
hospitality of the Turkish people.

### Eğirdir → Konya

An uneventful and boring trip led us to Konya. We decided to treat ourselves after the misfortune of the previous night
and stayed at a boutique hotel slightly over our budget.

{{< figure src="/blog/cappadocia/20241016_133220.webp"
attr="If ever in the area, definitely consider Araf for your stay."

Turkey and Palestine have a deep-rooted shared history, the former also the top provider of humanitarian aid to Gaza.
During our stay at Konya, we saw many joint flags decorating public spaces.

attr="Look closely, Turkey X Palestine."
align=center link="/blog/cappadocia/20241016_164711.webp" target="_blank" >}}

We also had the chance to watch the Dervish whirling dance. Dervishes are members of a Tariqa -a religious order of
Sufism- and more specifically, the Mevleni Order were the ones we saw at Konya. Whirling is considered a customary
meditation practice, that is through listening to music that one abandons ego or personal desires to achieve a closer
connection with Allah.

Men and women in Turkey do not have the same rights, and that is prominent in every aspect of their everyday life. For
example, the mosques have a restricted and much smaller area to pray at the back of the building, and no eye contact is
possible between the two sexes.

A catalyst to modernizing Turkey was Kemal Atatürk. He reformed the country's political, economic, and cultural
sectors. The alphabet was changed from the Ottoman to a Latin-based one. Women received equal civil and political rights
and a right to vote. The list goes on. He is commemorated through Turkey, and even today, at the time of his death (09:
05 on the 10th of November), vehicles and people stop for one minute in remembrance.

Despite the former improvements pointing Turkey in the right direction, it has gotten worse in the last decades. Human
rights violations, lack of freedom of speech, imprisonments, a huge gap between the formal rights and the social
position of women that, in turn, suffer a really high percentage of raping and murdering. That only scratches the
surface of a problematic state.

### Konya → Göreme

After five days of travel we would arrive at Göreme, our peak destination, and the furthest we would venture into
Turkey. We did not choose the fastest road there but rather planned a little detour to see Tuz Golu, one of the largest
hypersaline lakes in the world! Unfortunately, we did not go through the lake from a dirt road the locals use, as I
deemed it too risky given the fact it rained the night before, combined with the limited amount of daylight left.

The region of Cappadocia is truly magnificent, with a rich history, unique geological features, and full of Unesco
heritage sites. We chose to stay at Göreme, a popular town in Nevşehir. The houses there are carved out of cone-shaped
rocks that populate the area. Little is known about its early history and origins as it was not located on any major
travel roads.

align=center link="/blog/cappadocia/PXL_20241017_185903265.NIGHT.webp" target="_blank" >}}

We stayed at a cave house, a little outside the city center. We really enjoyed the cozy feeling they give you, but
unfortunately, there is no natural light coming in. For our short stay we enjoyed it and would definitely choose it
again. After a good nights sleep, we started our day by visiting the open air museum.

{{< figure src="/blog/cappadocia/PXL_20241018_083025556~2.webp"

align=center link="/blog/cappadocia/PXL_20241018_083025556~2.webp" target="_blank" >}}

There are numerous churches inside the open-air museum, all of them of great historical importance. Cappadocia was
considered a sanctuary for early Christians, and under the guiding hand of Saint Basil, many churches in the area were
built.

After a quick tour of the open air museum, we hopped on the bikes and went to the most famous valleys around Göreme.

To wrap the day, we decided to watch the sunset from the top of the Uchisar castle. It is riddled with tunnels
and has been used as a defensive stronghold for centuries, and the summit has a panoramic view of the whole region!
We were lucky (?) because it was freezing cold, so there were just a few people on its summit.

# Wrap up

That wraps up Cappadocia! What we learned:

- When off the bike, each couple should be completely independent. Sharing things (e.x. mobile data) is not practical,
  as you will eventually want to split up.
- A single large duffel bag is better than two smaller ones. Although a hustle to get things in and out when on the
  road, it sits lower on the bike, resulting in vastly improved handling.
- It is better to carry more technical clothes than casuals. The weather will vary vastly when traveling for long in
  spring/autumn, so it is hard to predict how it is going to fare out throughout the days.
- Passenger comfort is your priority. If you travel a lot solo, and especially in tough off-road conditions, you will
  develop some resilience to harsh conditions and the fatigue of long days. That is not the case with your pillion, and
  you ought to be considerate.
