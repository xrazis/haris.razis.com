# Introduction

We had been planning a trip to Cappadocia for months, Yiannoula and I started drafting a route from early 2024. When
Christos and I were doing part of the [Balkan TET](/posts/balkan-tet/), we would spend our evenings planning Cappadocia.
Funny to say the least. We didn't know where we would spend then night, but apparently, we were concerned about how many
luggage liters would be suitable for two up all the way to Cappadocia. Cilia would be Christos pillion—she needed
little to none persuasion to join us.

We would enter and leave Turkey from Çeşme. It made no sense to drive all the way to Alexandroupoli to cross the border
when we could just hop on the ferry and sleep the whole way there. Our plan was to go to Cappadocia through Isparta and
Konya, continue north to Ankara, drive by the Black Sea to İstanbul, and eventually make our way south by the Aegean,
where we would again board a boat at Çeşme.

# The story

### Chios-Çeşme

We boarded the ferry on Sunday night, and after a short delay off we were, officially the start of our journey! We
arrived at Chios after eight gruelling hours on the ship's deck, around six in the morning. The next ferry would leave
at eight, so we took a stroll down the marina while waiting.

Before you board the ferry to Turkey, you have to go through Greek customs, bikes included, and when you arrive in
Turkey, you have to go through their customs as well. It was moments before the boarding that when Christos remembered
that he forgot to issue a new green card for his bike.

> The 'green card' is a certificate of international insurance and is necessary when traveling to countries outside
> the European Economic Zone.

We decided to go forth with it and try to get through, which, of course, did not work out. Apparently, the custom
authorities are pretty strict on things like that. Who would have guessed. After some back and forth with the Greek
authorities, they decided to let us through and let their Turkish counterparts deal with us. If we did not have the
right paperwork, we would be sent straight back to Chios with the next ferry. We rushed to the ship and hopped on at the
last possible moment.

Our plan was simple enough, we had about 45 minutes to contact the insurance company and get the green card issued.
Small problem, it was eight in the morning, on a Monday. After placing a few phone calls, we managed to get hold of
Christos agent, who unfortunately was sick and on a leave. Luckily, he was kind enough to call the right person at the
insurance company and get him to issue us a green card as fast as possible.

Should my technologically illiterate friend have an online insurance, we could have done this ourselves and almost
instantly.

Once the green card was emailed to us, we went through the Turkish side of the customs. I was part of a random check,
where they passed the bike through an X-ray scanner. Our first stop would be Pamukkale, about 350 kilometers away.

### Pamukkale

Pamukkale in Turkish means 'cotton castle'. The city is surrounded by cotton fields, and the hill overlooking Pamukkale
is white as snow from the sediment (travertine) that has been deposited over the years.

We found the entrance to the Unesco world heritage site to be ridiculously expensive, and in combination with the large
crowds on the hills, we decided to skip it. We would soon realize that all the popular attractions had high ticket
prices for the tourists, whereas natives would pay a tenth of the price. 

On our way out from Pamukkale, we had a quick stop at Red Springs, where most of the locals would be. Although nothing
special

That would wrap our short visit to Pamukkale,
