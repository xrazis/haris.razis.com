# Introduction

A while ago i submitted my thesis with its subject being the study of the architecture of Body Area Networks (BAN) and Personal Area Networks (PAN), and their applications, with the aim of optimizing the performance of athletes, by enhancing personalized training practices. I was also tasked with creating an e-sport application that would collect and analyze data on the athleteâ€™s body position in real-time. I named the e-sport application Icnhaea, and i will be referring to it as so for the rest of this post.

Developing Ichnaea proved a challenge for me, as it tested my knowledge and understanding for full stack applications. I wanted to built a resilient, multi tenant application, with scaling capabilities that would not just tick the boxes for a thesis, but be a worthwhile project that would make me a better engineer.
