At the time of writing its length is somewhere around 100.000 kilometers, and it is constantly growing. Each country has its respective linesmen that curates the GPX, but the community behind is much bigger than a single person!\nI have known Christos for the better part of my adult life. We met at a bicycle group ride I participated with my other dearest friend, Apostolos. We all hit it along from the beginning, so we started riding, camping, touring, and racing bikes together. After the frenzy of the road bicycle thing steamed off for me and Christos, we both turned to motorbikes, since carrying a bicycle with us was no more a worry.\nMy first big bike was (and still is) a KTM LC4 640 Enduro. Christos purchased a Suzuki V-STROM 650. We rode a few times together but due to COVID and us living in different areas for a while it was mostly short road rides. I already travelled a lot off-road by that point and was constantly telling my friends how awesome it is to ride on hard and difficult roads through the mountains where you get to injure yourself in the process.\nI think the point where it clicked for him was the first off-road ride we did together, 2 or 3 years ago.\nSomewhere along the Ziria mountain range.\nHaving done my self a big part of the Greek TET, it was a no-brainer when Christos told me we should go on a big trip to the Balkans. Up to that point we both had mid-sized adventure bikes, enough experience to tackle hard roads on them, and not enough experience to travel long distance on motorcycles.\nAlbania We left noon of the first day of June and decided to ride the national road to the border crossing of Konispol. This way we could stay at Sarand√´ for the night and start the TET fresh the next day. The first part from Sarand√´ to K√´lcyr√´ was nothing new for us, the scenery was (obviously) very similar to Greece and the off-road was mostly rocky.\nMonument to Communism.\nThe canyons of Nivic√´s.\nThe place we stopped for lunch, alongside the Vjosa River.\nAfter food, we continued riding with the purpose of finding a nice camping spot where we could spend the night. And Christos did. He managed to hit a rock with such force and at such a bad angle that a retaining screw holding the bash plate bent the frame and pierced through the oil pan.\nThe still pink 10-50 oil at the Albanian Countryside.\nGuess what was the one thing we bought but forgot to pack? Yes, metal glue. After a day‚Äôs back and forth to the closest village, that was about 30kms from where we camped the night, we managed to find some cold steel and car oil to fix the Tenere.\nWaiting for the cold steel to dry.\nThe Tenere is up and running!\nWe decided to go to Elbassan for the night, which was a 4-hour drive from where we were. After a quick coffee stop at Berat, we arrived at Elbassan and toured their beautiful old city. The fourth day we had planned to do 250km and spend the night somewhere close the border, so we could enter Montenegro the next morning. So we thought.\nAlbania does not have food-rich bakeries like we do‚Ä¶\nThe Tenere taking a siesta.\nAn active mine in Lura where we decided to stop for a photo.\nThe road up to the mine was not really bad, but we were tired and hungry. We still had 60kms in the Lura mountain and then an easy gravel road towards Shkod√´r. I can say with certainty, these were some of the most difficult kilometers I‚Äôve had on two wheels. We needed nearly 3 hours to cross the rest of the Lura mountain, as it was extremely rocky, and we struggled with the heavy bikes. They warned us that we would end up passing the point of no return and the road ahead would be gruelling, and boy did we not listen.\nRocks, rocks, and rocks.\nWe couldn‚Äôt see the road either ü§∑.\nDespite the hard times it gave us, it is still one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited.\nAfter a good nights sleep and some excellent food at Fush√´-Lur√´ we were off for Montenegro. We planned an easy day and a stay at Podgorica, so we could have some much-needed rest.\nThe road from Fush√´-Lur√´ to Shkod√´r.\nPodgorica has a large river crossing through its city center - it is full of green parks.\nAt Podgorica, we decided that camping and travelling at such a fast pace was not manageable. We didn‚Äôt want to waste time getting food supplies and cooking, setting and gathering the gear, and doing all the things camp related. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we both enjoy camping, it just did not make sense as rooms were cheap and the food even cheaper. We left our camping gear at the rooms we were staying, and we would pick it up on the return. Lightweight baby!\nThe driving at Montenegro was not easy, but after every hard section we got rewarded with stunning views.\nA plateau at around 1600m of altitude.\nI had a little mishap at the plateau displayed above where I managed to throw the 790 into a mud pit, and we spend the next 45 minutes trying to pull it out. Including that, it made the perfect day on a bike. We slept near the border and the morning after we crossed to Bosnia.\nOnce we figured out the Enduristan panniers we loved their simplicity. We both travelled on 24 liters.\nThe war in Bosnia and Herzegovina ended in 1995 leaving over 100.000 dead, millions displaced, and thousands of mines still active. There were multiple occasions were we passed by group graves with 300 or 400 names written on the tombstone or plains that were completely altered by bombing.\nWe were advised to stick to the road.\nDense forests and mud.\nAt Bosnia, we spent our first night at Mostar. A beautiful city - although a bit touristic - that has a Unesco heritage site, the old bridge of Stari Most. The bridge was completely destroyed in 1993, but was reconstructed from the very same materials, retrieved from the river bellow!\nRama, an artificial lake built in the 60s.\nOne of the many plains that had the scars of the war.\n≈†atorsko lake, our last stop before entering Croatia.\nOur second night at Bosnia was near the border to Croatia, at Glamoƒç. Nothing special, just a nights sleep and off to Croatia. At Knin we decided to have a rest day and do some sightseeing.\nAt the castle of Knin.\n","wordCount":"1148","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-06-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-06-20T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/balkan-tet/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"xrazis ¬∑ Haris Razis","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="xrazis (Alt + H)">xrazis</a><div class=logo-switches><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">TET Albania-Montenegro-Bosnia-Croatia</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-06-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>20 June, 2024</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/xrazis/haris.razis.com/tree/main/content/posts/balkan-tet.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#introduction aria-label=Introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#albania aria-label=Albania>Albania</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h1 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h1><p>The <a href=https://transeurotrail.org/>Trans Euro Trail</a> (abbreviated TET) is a scenic GPX route that spans the whole
