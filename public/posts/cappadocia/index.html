We had been planning a trip to Cappadocia for months, Yiannoula and I started drafting a route from early 2024. When
Christos and I were doing part of the Balkan TET, we would spend our evenings planning Cappadocia.
Funny to say the least. We didn&rsquo;t know where we would spend then night, but apparently, we were concerned about how many
luggage liters would be suitable for two up all the way to Cappadocia. Cilia would be Christos pillion—she needed
little to none persuasion to join us."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=http://localhost:1313/posts/cappadocia/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.7ada26225601177355d925d8020cc425b32600338001f38a6a764b249f875c98.css integrity="sha256-etomIlYBF3NV2SXYAgzEJbMmADOAAfOKanZLJJ+HXJg=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=http://localhost:1313/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=http://localhost:1313/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=http://localhost:1313/favicon.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=http://localhost:1313/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=http://localhost:1313/posts/cappadocia/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="Two up Cappadocia"><meta property="og:description" content="Introduction
