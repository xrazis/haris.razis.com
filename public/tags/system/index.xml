      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been maintaining a managed Plesk server on a Greek hosting provider for the past few years. It contains a handful
of production websites and their respective mail servers. While it was okayish for basic hosting needs, the demands
quickly outgrew it with limitations starting to appear on the infrastructure, supported technologies, and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a little market research, I decided that the way forward would be Digital Ocean, as they provide solid cloud
infrastructure with a plethora of tools. I also decided to keep Plesk as the server
management platform. It will be adequate for the low needs of basic Node.js sites and small eshops, with the
added benefit of an embedded mail server, security features, automations, and backups.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while ago I submitted my thesis with its subject being the study of the architecture of BAN and PAN, and their
applications, with the aim of optimizing athletes performance, by enhancing personalized training practices. I was also
tasked with creating an e-sport application that would collect and analyze data on the athlete’s body position in
real-time. I named the e-sport application Icnhaea, and I will be referring to it as so for the rest of this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
